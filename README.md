Code from my live-coding YouTube video:

[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/LwnPqUBLDYY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwnPqUBLDYY)

Develop:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Deploy:

```
npm run deploy
```

Todo (for the next videos, possibly):

- [ ] chunking of articles larger than 4096 characters, mp3 concatenation
- [ ] mp3 duration for RSS
- [ ] web view of the feed, with mp3 players
- [ ] nicer UI
- [ ] mp3 tags for author, title, etc.
- [ ] authN, authZ
- [ ] error handling
- [ ] custom domain
